🏗️ Designing Management Group Hierarchy
Where Governance Actually Starts

Most people think Management Groups are just:

“folders to organize subscriptions”

That thinking is wrong.

🔥 What Management Groups Really Are

Management Groups define governance boundaries — not structure for convenience

They control:

Policy inheritance
Access control (RBAC)
Compliance enforcement
Operational separation
❌ The Wrong Way to Design MGs
1. Designing based on teams
Finance
HR
Retail Banking

👉 Problem:

teams change
org structures evolve
governance breaks
2. Designing based on applications
App1
App2
App3

👉 Problem:

not scalable
no policy grouping
no governance value
✅ The Right Way

Design based on:

Control boundaries that will remain stable over time

🧠 The 3 Core Dimensions You Must Think In

Before drawing anything, answer:

1. Governance & Policy Boundaries
Where do policies differ?
Where do controls change?

Example:

PCI vs Non-PCI
Regulated vs Non-regulated
2. Platform vs Workloads

Separate:

Platform (shared services)
Landing Zones (applications)

👉 This is non-negotiable in enterprise design

3. Lifecycle & Risk Segmentation
Production vs Non-production
Sandbox vs Controlled environments
Quarantine / Decommission
🏦 Realistic Enterprise Structure

Here’s a practical starting point:

Tenant Root
│
├── Platform
│   ├── Identity
│   ├── Connectivity
│   └── Management-Security
│
├── Landing Zones
│   ├── Regulated
│   │   ├── PCI
│   │   ├── GDPR
│   │   └── Core-Banking
│   │
│   ├── Non-Regulated
│   │   ├── Production
│   │   └── Non-Production
│   │
│   └── Sandbox
│
├── Transitional
│   ├── Quarantine
│   └── Decommissioning
🔍 Why This Structure Works
Platform is isolated
Central ownership
High control
No workload noise
Landing Zones are structured by risk
Regulated workloads inherit stricter policies
Non-regulated get more flexibility
Sandbox is isolated
innovation allowed
risk contained
Transitional zones exist
handle real-world mess
not everything is clean
⚠️ Key Design Decisions You Must Make
Decision 1: Where do policies differ?

👉 This defines your MG split

Decision 2: What is centrally controlled?

👉 Platform vs workload separation

Decision 3: Where do you expect exceptions?

👉 Plan for:

sandbox
quarantine
temporary states
🔥 Real-World Mistake

Most teams do this:

“Let’s copy Microsoft’s reference architecture exactly”

Problem:

It’s generic
Your bank is not generic
Your constraints are different
🧠 Architect Thinking

You don’t ask:

“What is the correct MG structure?”

You ask:

“Where do I need different control behavior?”

🔁 Example (Important)
If PCI needs:
no public IP
restricted regions
strict logging

👉 It must be a separate MG

If Dev vs Prod:
same policies
different access

👉 Don’t create MG — use subscription/RBAC

💡 One-Line Rule

Create a new Management Group only when policy or governance needs to change significantly

Where Most People Go Wrong
Too many MGs → complexity
Too few MGs → no control
What Comes Next

Now that MG structure is clear, the next logical step is:

👉 Subscription Design Strategy

Because:

MG defines governance
Subscription defines ownership, cost, and deployment boundary
